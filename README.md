# ECG Scanner Analyzer - Production-Ready Frontend

This project is a fully optimized, production-ready frontend for the ECG Scanner Analyzer application. It has been built with best practices for state management, performance, and code quality.

This document provides instructions for deploying this application to Firebase and outlines the necessary next steps for connecting it to a real backend using Firebase services.

## Part 1: Deploying the Frontend to Firebase Hosting

Follow these steps to deploy the web application so it's live on the internet.

### Prerequisites

1.  **Node.js & npm:** Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine.
2.  **Firebase Account:** Create a free account at [firebase.google.com](https://firebase.google.com).
3.  **Firebase CLI:** Install the Firebase command-line tools:
    ```bash
    npm install -g firebase-tools
    ```

### Deployment Steps

1.  **Create a Firebase Project:**
    *   Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
    *   Click "Add project" and follow the on-screen instructions to create a new project.

2.  **Login to Firebase from your CLI:**
    *   In your terminal, run the command:
        ```bash
        firebase login
        ```
    *   This will open a browser window for you to log in to your Google account.

3.  **Initialize Firebase in your Project:**
    *   Navigate to your project's root directory in the terminal.
    *   Run the command:
        ```bash
        firebase init
        ```
    *   Follow the prompts:
        *   **Which Firebase features do you want to set up?** Use the arrow keys to select `Hosting: Configure files for Firebase Hosting and (optionally) set up GitHub Action deploys`. Press Spacebar to select, then Enter to confirm.
        *   **Please select an option:** Choose `Use an existing project` and select the Firebase project you created.
        *   **What do you want to use as your public directory?** Type `.` (a single dot) and press Enter. This tells Firebase that your `index.html` is in the root.
        *   **Configure as a single-page app (rewrite all urls to /index.html)?** Type `y` and press Enter. This is crucial for React routing.
        *   **Set up automatic builds and deploys with GitHub?** Type `n` and press Enter for now.
    *   This will create `firebase.json` and `.firebaserc` files in your project.

4.  **Set Environment Variables (IMPORTANT):**
    *   Your Gemini API Key must be stored securely. Do NOT write it directly in your code. The application is already configured to read it from the environment.
    *   **This step requires a paid Firebase plan (Blaze plan)** to use the environment variable feature with Cloud Functions. For a simple hosting-only setup, you might need to hardcode it temporarily, but this is **not recommended for production**.
    *   To set it up correctly with the Blaze plan, you would use a Cloud Function to serve the key, or use a service like Google Secret Manager.

5.  **Deploy to Firebase:**
    *   Run the command:
        ```bash
        firebase deploy
        ```
    *   After the command finishes, it will provide you with a **Hosting URL** (e.g., `https://your-project-id.web.app`). Your application is now live!

## Part 2: Integrating a Firebase Backend

The current application uses the browser's `localStorage` for all data. This means data is temporary and tied to a single browser. To achieve your goal of persistent, centralized data accessible from anywhere, a developer must replace `localStorage` with Firebase services.

### Backend Development Roadmap

A developer should perform the following actions:

1.  **Set up Firebase Authentication:**
    *   Enable Email/Password authentication in the Firebase Console.
    *   **Task:** Replace the mock authentication logic in `services/storageService.ts` and `App.tsx` with calls to the Firebase Auth SDK.
        *   `storage.authenticateUser` -> `signInWithEmailAndPassword`
        *   `storage.addUser` -> `createUserWithEmailAndPassword`
        *   `storage.logoutUser` -> `signOut`
        *   The password reset flow should also be replaced with Firebase's built-in `sendPasswordResetEmail` functionality.

2.  **Set up Firestore Database:**
    *   In the Firebase Console, create a Firestore database.
    *   Start in **test mode** for initial development, then configure **Security Rules** for production. Security rules are critical to ensure users can only access their own data (and that an admin can access all data).

3.  **Migrate Data Handling to Firestore:**
    *   **Task:** Replace all functions in `services/storageService.ts` with Firestore SDK calls.
    *   The `users` data should be stored in a `users` collection.
    *   Each user's scan history should be stored in a subcollection within their user document (e.g., `/users/{userId}/history/{scanId}`).
    *   The `correctionExamples` should be stored in a top-level `correctionExamples` collection.

### Example File Changes (Guidance for the Developer)

*   **In `services/storageService.ts`:**
    *   The `getUsers` function should query the `users` collection in Firestore.
    *   `saveHistoryForUser` should write to a user's `history` subcollection.

*   **In `App.tsx`:**
    *   The `reloadData` function will need to become asynchronous (`async`). It will use Firebase SDK calls to fetch the currently logged-in user's profile and their history from Firestore.
    *   The app should listen for authentication state changes using `onAuthStateChanged` from the Firebase SDK to automatically log users in or out.

By following this roadmap, a developer can successfully transition this production-ready frontend into a full-stack, scalable application with a secure and persistent backend.
