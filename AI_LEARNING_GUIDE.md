# ü§ñ AI Model Learning System - ECG Scanner

## Overview
The ECG Scanner now includes a sophisticated AI learning system that continuously improves diagnosis accuracy by learning from user corrections and feedback.

## üéØ Key Features

### 1. **Real-Time Learning**
- **Correction Tracking**: Every time a diagnosis is corrected, the system learns
- **Confidence Adjustment**: Updates confidence scores based on feedback
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies common misdiagnosis patterns

### 2. **Admin Analytics Dashboard**
- **Model Performance Metrics**: Track accuracy improvements over time
- **Correction Patterns**: Identify which conditions are frequently misdiagnosed
- **User Feedback Analytics**: Understand user interaction patterns

### 3. **Feedback Collection System**
- **Structured Feedback**: Standardized format for corrections
- **Notes & Context**: Additional information from medical professionals
- **Confidence Scoring**: Track how corrections affect model confidence

## üìä API Endpoints

### Admin Operations
```javascript
// Clear all scan history (Admin only)
POST /api/admin/clear-all-history

// Clear specific user's history (Admin only)
DELETE /api/admin/users/{userId}/history

// Get AI feedback data (Admin only)
GET /api/admin/ai-feedback

// Get AI model statistics (Admin only)
GET /api/admin/ai-model-stats
```

### User Feedback
```javascript
// Submit correction for AI learning
POST /api/scans/{scanId}/feedback
{
  "corrected_prediction": "Atrial Fibrillation",
  "notes": "Patient showed irregular heartbeat pattern",
  "feedback_type": "correction",
  "new_confidence": 0.95,
  "analysis_details": {...}
}
```

## üîç Learning Metrics

### Performance Indicators
- **Correction Rate**: Percentage of diagnoses that needed correction
- **Improvement Potential**: Areas where the model can improve
- **Confidence Trends**: How model confidence changes over time
- **Pattern Analysis**: Most common misdiagnosis patterns

### Data Collection
```json
{
  "total_feedback": 1250,
  "corrections": 180,
  "confirmations": 1070,
  "correction_rate": 14.4,
  "improvement_potential": 85.6,
  "correction_patterns": [
    {
      "original": "Normal Sinus Rhythm",
      "corrected": "Atrial Fibrillation",
      "count": 45
    }
  ]
}
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Guide

### 1. **Frontend Integration**
```typescript
// Submit correction
await submitAIFeedbackAPI(scanId, {
  corrected_prediction: "Corrected Diagnosis",
  notes: "Additional context",
  new_confidence: 0.92
});

// Get AI statistics (Admin)
const stats = await getAIModelStatsAPI();
```

### 2. **Admin Dashboard Features**
- **Clear All History**: Remove all scan data (irreversible)
- **Clear User History**: Remove specific user's data
- **View AI Learning**: See how the model is improving
- **Export Analytics**: Download learning data for analysis

### 3. **Database Schema**
```sql
-- AI Model Feedback Table
CREATE TABLE ai_model_feedback (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    scan_id UUID REFERENCES scan(id),
    original_prediction VARCHAR(100),
    corrected_prediction VARCHAR(100),
    confidence_change FLOAT,
    feedback_type VARCHAR(20),
    user_id UUID REFERENCES user(id),
    notes TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

## üìà Learning Process

### 1. **Data Collection**
- Every scan correction is logged
- Confidence scores are tracked
- User notes provide context

### 2. **Pattern Analysis**
- Identifies common misdiagnosis patterns
- Tracks improvement over time
- Highlights areas needing attention

### 3. **Model Updates**
- Corrections feed into model retraining
- Confidence thresholds are adjusted
- New patterns are incorporated

## üéõÔ∏è Admin Controls

### Bulk Operations
- **Clear All History**: Remove all scan data system-wide
- **Clear User History**: Remove specific user's scan history
- **User Management**: Delete user accounts with their data

### Analytics Features
- **Real-time Statistics**: Live dashboard of model performance
- **Historical Trends**: Track improvements over time
- **Export Capabilities**: Download data for external analysis

## üîí Security & Privacy

### Data Protection
- **User Consent**: Explicit consent for data usage
- **Anonymization**: Personal data is anonymized for learning
- **Access Control**: Only admins can access learning data

### Audit Trail
- **All changes logged** with user attribution
- **Data retention policies** configurable
- **Compliance ready** for medical regulations

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. **Enable AI Learning**
```bash
# The system is automatically enabled
# No additional configuration required
```

### 2. **Access Admin Features**
1. Login as admin user
2. Navigate to Admin Dashboard
3. Use AI Analytics section
4. Monitor learning progress

### 3. **Monitor Improvements**
- Check AI Model Stats regularly
- Review correction patterns
- Adjust thresholds based on data

## üìä Expected Improvements

### Accuracy Gains
- **Week 1**: 5-10% improvement in common conditions
